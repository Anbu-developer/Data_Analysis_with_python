### Summary of Your EDA Python Code:

Your Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) code is focused on analyzing the relationship between various attributes in the dataset and visualizing their patterns. Here's a concise breakdown of its key steps:

1. **Satisfaction Level vs. Attrition**:
   - **Objective**: To compare employee satisfaction levels between those who stayed and those who left.
   - **Code**: Uses a boxplot (`sns.boxplot`) to visualize the distribution of `satisfaction_level` for the two groups (`left` column).
   - **Insight**: Helps identify if lower satisfaction levels are associated with higher attrition rates.

2. **Correlation Heatmap**:
   - **Objective**: To examine the strength and direction of linear relationships between numerical variables.
   - **Code**: Filters numeric columns using `select_dtypes`, calculates correlations with `data.corr()`, and visualizes them using `sns.heatmap`.
   - **Insight**: Identifies highly correlated variables, redundancies, and potential predictors for models.

### Short Description:

Your EDA code leverages Python libraries like Seaborn and Matplotlib to visualize employee data. It identifies patterns like the impact of satisfaction levels on attrition and examines inter-variable relationships through a correlation heatmap. These insights provide a foundation for deeper analysis and decision-making.
